Mean and Varianz


1. Downloaded

2. Read the files

3. Merged dataframes

4. Cleaned a little:
4–5 files had missing vp values, which I filled in manually.
Some column names had leading spaces, so I read the CSVs with skipinitialspace=True.
Removed practice trials

5. Participants understood the buttons differently..
